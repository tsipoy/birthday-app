# Birthday App

## Structure of the project
- Fecth bootstrap through a link in the html.
- Grab few elements from html.
- Fetch the data from the `people.json`.
- Store the data in the `local storage`.
- Populate these data using html. Inside that population, I format the birthday date. After, I call that function in another new function.
- Then, I generate the edit(open modal). So, I create editPopup function, editAddPopup fuction and add event listener for the input to be submitted.
- When they are finished, I create the delete function with its confirm popup, the add event listener too.
- Then, I put the some events listers at the end.
- I wrap all the function inside a big `async`.

## If I had more time
- I would still work with the delete button and the edit button when the users add a new birthday.
- Also would like to work with the `sort` and the `filter input`.

## I learnt many things from this project but also I still need more practice as well.

## Most of the parts in this project are challenging for me such as:
- grabbing the data from the inputs
- submitting the form.
- the date between two days.
- deleting the the data in the `tr`,
- I would like to have more explanation about grabbing the inputs from the form and deleting the `tr.
